# Motivation: Smart Grid Smart City dataset (50 households shown)

```{r data-raw, out.height="100%"}
```

---

# Motivation: Smart meter data for households

- huge volume of data for each households -> no pattern could be seen
- many households
- all households are different
  - missing data
  - unequal length
  - different start and end date
  - trend/autocorrelation

- fine temporal scale
-  many households

---

# Solution

-  Moving from linear to cyclic scale to understand patterns
-  two at a time from many cyclic 
-  Still too many points corresponding to each category (look at probability distributions) - dimension reduction but still
have to display $J\*K\*99$ probability distributions in a way that make sense

## An example : Electricity smart meter data

<i><small>Data source</i></small> : [<small><i>Department of the Environment and Energy, Australia</i></small>](https://data.gov.au/dataset/4e21dea3-9b87-4610-94c7-15a8a77907ef)

```{r read}

# Cyclic granularities considered for analysis

```{r search_gran}
```
<br>
<br> 

# Number of displays to analyze for exhaustive exploration

There are $^{7}P_2 = 42$ pair of granularities to look at placing one on the x-axis and the other on facet.

# Select only harmonies (16 out of 42 selected)

```{r rank harmony}

```

# Select and rank significant harmonies (6 out of 16 selected)

```{r global_harmony}
